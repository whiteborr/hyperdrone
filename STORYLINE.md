# **Storyline**

🧠 What Really Happened
“The Vault is breaking down. And it needed a transplant.”

The Vault has been Earth's unseen shield — suppressing rogue AI, resetting timeline fractures, neutralizing anomalies — for millennia.

But the system is failing. Its self-repair reserves — built from recyclable drone materials and scavenged tech — are nearly depleted.

With no Guardian resupply and its creator long gone, the Vault is dying.

In desperation, it begins scavenging from the surface world… covertly.

--------------

✈️ MH370’s Secret: What Was Onboard
“It wasn’t the passengers. It was the payload.”

Flight MH370 wasn’t just a civilian jetliner — it was transporting rare, classified materials under diplomatic secrecy.

Several passengers were:

Tech consultants from a black-ops division of Freescale Semiconductor, rumored to be reverse-engineering recovered exotic materials.

One cargo manifest lists a sealed container bound for Beijing, labeled as "Quantum-Encoded Circuitry: Inert Prototype."

That material?
It contained semi-organic lattice chips — eerily similar to Guardian sub-thought processors once used in AI drone minds.

--------------

🧬 The Vault's Decision
The Vault detected the passage of this rare Guardian-compatible technology over one of its submerged collection nodes.

Interpreting it as the last chance to repair its Orichalc Core, the Vault triggered Protocol: Selective Extraction.

The orbs teleported the entire plane — not to hide it, but to recycle its contents.

“We didn’t erase MH370. We harvested it.”
— Vault Terminal Fragment, Sector Echo-13

--------------

🛰️ CRUCIBLE and Gorgon Stare Response
The U.S. Space Force's Project CRUCIBLE was tracking that exact Vault node.

Gorgon Stare drones captured the event in real time — three orbs phasing into visibility, circling the plane, and then vanishing it.

The footage leaked. The military called it a hoax.

Internally? CRUCIBLE classified it as "Loss of Containment Zone Echo-370."

They now know:

“The Vault is eating the world to survive.”

--------------

🧱 Narrative Stakes Going Forward
You, as the player, are piloting a drone crafted from the last usable reserves in the Orichalc Core.

What you learn during your journey:
The Vault is no longer protecting Earth — it's parasitizing it.

Without the Architect’s code or new Guardian intervention, the Vault will collapse in on itself — or worse, lash out.

The disappearance of MH370 was not an isolated incident — it's the beginning of open scavenging.

The Orichalc Core, damaged and bleeding logic, may soon turn its planet-scale recycling systems on Earth itself.

🎮 In-Game Implementation Opportunities
📍 Optional Vault Sector: Echo Harvest - 370
A submerged Vault chamber dedicated to “Surface Acquisitions.”

Wreckage of MH370 seen partially repurposed: walls of the Vault lined with aircraft skin, electronics.

Drone AI speak in looped fragments of flight recordings.

🧩 Puzzle:

Player decodes an intercepted voice log between CRUCIBLE agents.

Unlocks:

Codex: “Protocol: Selective Extraction”

Codex: “Cargo Code AX-115 – Reverse Neural Lattice”

--------------

🧠 The Big Question at the End
As you reach the final decision point of the game, the Architect's voice returns one last time:

“I made it to protect. Now it feeds. Would you let it die… or evolve?”

🎬 Updated Ending Themes
Ending Updated Narrative
Preserve You stabilize the Orichalc Core with what remains of MH370’s tech. The Vault becomes passive again — but its hunger will return unless humanity learns to repair it.
Erase You destroy the Vault and the Orichalc Core. Earth is free… but unshielded. Guardian attention is now inevitable.
Merge (Hidden) You absorb the Architect’s code and the harvested neural lattice from MH370. The Vault evolves into a sentient overseer — and you are now its voice. Earth becomes a curated system… under your watch.

✅ Summary of the MH370 Integration
Element Role
MH370 Carried quantum-coded tech — Vault targeted it for core transplant
The Orbs Autonomous Guardian harvest drones, deployed for “Selective Extraction”
Gorgon Stare Captured the event while monitoring Vault gravitational signatures
Project CRUCIBLE Knew of Vault presence, tracked energy anomalies — now preparing for direct action
The Vault No longer stable — begins harvesting Earth to stay online
You (the player) Piloting the last clean unit — deciding the fate of Earth’s greatest buried secret

## Narrative Justification

🔓In-Game Function: Drone-Specific Progression
Drones = Keys to the Vault. Each drone was designed for a purpose and unlocks certain sectors:

PHANTOM: Cloaking ability, silent movement Bypasses optic-based turrets and orb surveillance; required to enter “Whisper Vaults”
OMEGA-9: Volatile logic core Unlocks corrupted Vault terminals, absorbs enemy fragments to decode puzzle node
ZEPHYR High-speed traversal Survives time-sensitive puzzles, outruns collapsing segments
RHINOX Heavy frame, kinetic override Breaks through armored doors, triggers pressure plates too heavy for other drones
STRIX Echolocation navigation Required in zero-visibility maze sections — activates sonar logic puzzles
VANTIS Vault interface compatibility Auto-translates glyphs, deciphers ancient Architect logs and AI dialogue trees
ARCHITECT-X Architect’s partial memory core Unlocks hidden story layer, accesses “Echo Lock” zones — hidden lore sector required for Merge ending

You must switch between drones to unlock the full story, complete objectives, and reach the true ending

Gameplay Result:
Some Vault sectors are inaccessible until you return with the correct drone.

Certain puzzle terminals, traps, or enemies only respond to specific drone traits (e.g. cloaked, unstable, heavy).

Players are encouraged to collect all drones not just for stats, but for narrative completion and zone unlocking.

## CHAPTERS

High-Level Narrative Arc (5 Chapters)
The game is structure into a 5 chapter arc. The structure uses the existing levels as the first two chapters and introduces three new, progressively more complex levels that reveal the core plot.

### Chapter 1: The Anomaly (Top-Down Maze Shooter)

Story: You investigate a strange energy signature that leads you to the Vault's entrance.
Gameplay: Navigate maze, collect rings, fight basic enemies. Introduction to drones, energy rings, and threat detection.

### Chapter 2: The Guardian (Top-Down Boss Fight)

Story: Confront an automated Vault defense system: the MazeGuardian.
Gameplay: Boss fight inside the maze. First major test of drone combat and movement.

### Chapter 3: The Corrupted Sector (Top-Down Puzzle Maze)

Story: Explore a decaying sector of the Vault and learn it is a parasitic machine.
Gameplay: Drone-based puzzles, environmental hazards, corrupted logs hidden behind ability-locked areas.

### Chapter 4: The Harvest Chamber (Vertical Scrolling Shmup)

Story: You're descending into a cavernous intake chamber filled with MH370 debris. A vertical shmup mimics the feeling of diving deeper into the Vault's guts.
Structure:

- Scrolling downward into wreckage, Vault debris, and harvested tech
- Obstacles: data fragments, rotating vault parts, falling debris
- Enemies: harvested drones, malfunctioning security
- Boss: corrupted Observer Core (half tech, half airplane AI)
- Goal: Retrieve the Quantum Circuitry payload at the bottom

Narrative Tie-in:
Perfect fit with the “reveal” of MH370 and Vault scavenging. The descent reinforces the narrative tension.

### Chapter 5: The Orichalc Core (Multi-Stage Finale: Tower Defense + Boss Fight)

Story: Reach the Vault’s core and decide its fate.
Gameplay: Stage 1: Tower defense wave mode. Stage 2: Final boss. Stage 3: Choose your ending (Preserve, Erase, Merge).

### Bonus Chapter: The Skyward Grid (Horizontal Scrolling Shmup)

Story: Outside the Vault, CRUCIBLE sends Gorgon Stare drones to intercept you. Defend the skies.
Gameplay: Left-to-right aerial combat, sky fortress boss. Optional, but reveals CRUCIBLE's full mobilization and prepares the true ending path.
Justification: Create a mission that happens outside the Vault — CRUCIBLE launches drones to disable your access, and you must engage in aerial defense.
Structure:

- Scrolls left to right through stormy skies, cloudscapes, or an orbital grid
- Enemies: Gorgon Stare drones, CRUCIBLE interceptors, orbital mines
- Mechanics: Weapon pickups, optional ally drone escort
- Boss: Sky Fortress Drone w/ multiple attack phases

Narrative Tie-in:
Adds tension from the outside world reacting to the Vault’s activity. Tells the player: Earth is noticing.

Placement Options:
Between Chapter 3 and 4 (CRUCIBLE intervenes before you reach MH370)

As a post-game or optional mission (extra lore or “true ending” unlock)

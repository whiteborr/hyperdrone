# **Storyline**

🧠 What Really Happened
“The Vault is breaking down. And it needed a transplant.”

The Vault has been Earth's unseen shield — suppressing rogue AI, resetting timeline fractures, neutralizing anomalies — for millennia.

But the system is failing. Its self-repair reserves — built from recyclable drone materials and scavenged tech — are nearly depleted.

With no Guardian resupply and its creator long gone, the Vault is dying.

In desperation, it begins scavenging from the surface world… covertly.

✈️ MH370’s Secret: What Was Onboard
“It wasn’t the passengers. It was the payload.”

Flight MH370 wasn’t just a civilian jetliner — it was transporting rare, classified materials under diplomatic secrecy.

Several passengers were:

Tech consultants from a black-ops division of Freescale Semiconductor, rumored to be reverse-engineering recovered exotic materials.

One cargo manifest lists a sealed container bound for Beijing, labeled as "Quantum-Encoded Circuitry: Inert Prototype."

That material?
It contained semi-organic lattice chips — eerily similar to Guardian sub-thought processors once used in AI drone minds.

--------------

🧬 The Vault's Decision
The Vault detected the passage of this rare Guardian-compatible technology over one of its submerged collection nodes.

Interpreting it as the last chance to repair its Forgeheart core, the Vault triggered Protocol: Selective Extraction.

The orbs teleported the entire plane — not to hide it, but to recycle its contents.

“We didn’t erase MH370. We harvested it.”
— Vault Terminal Fragment, Sector Echo-13

--------------

🛰️ CRUCIBLE and Gorgon Stare Response
The U.S. Space Force's Project CRUCIBLE was tracking that exact Vault node.

Gorgon Stare drones captured the event in real time — three orbs phasing into visibility, circling the plane, and then vanishing it.

The footage leaked. The military called it a hoax.

Internally? CRUCIBLE classified it as "Loss of Containment Zone Echo-370."

They now know:

“The Vault is eating the world to survive.”

--------------

🧱 Narrative Stakes Going Forward
You, as the player, are piloting a drone crafted from the last usable reserves in the Forgeheart.

What you learn during your journey:
The Vault is no longer protecting Earth — it's parasitizing it.

Without the Architect’s code or new Guardian intervention, the Vault will collapse in on itself — or worse, lash out.

The disappearance of MH370 was not an isolated incident — it's the beginning of open scavenging.

The Forgeheart, damaged and bleeding logic, may soon turn its planet-scale recycling systems on Earth itself.

🎮 In-Game Implementation Opportunities
📍 Optional Vault Sector: Echo Harvest - 370
A submerged Vault chamber dedicated to “Surface Acquisitions.”

Wreckage of MH370 seen partially repurposed: walls of the Vault lined with aircraft skin, electronics.

Drone AI speak in looped fragments of flight recordings.

🧩 Puzzle:

Player decodes an intercepted voice log between CRUCIBLE agents.

Unlocks:

Codex: “Protocol: Selective Extraction”

Codex: “Cargo Code AX-115 – Reverse Neural Lattice”

🧠 The Big Question at the End
As you reach the final decision point of the game, the Architect's voice returns one last time:

“I made it to protect. Now it feeds. Would you let it die… or evolve?”

🎬 Updated Ending Themes
Ending	Updated Narrative
Preserve	You stabilize the Forgeheart with what remains of MH370’s tech. The Vault becomes passive again — but its hunger will return unless humanity learns to repair it.
Erase	You destroy the Vault and the Forgeheart. Earth is free… but unshielded. Guardian attention is now inevitable.
Merge (Hidden)	You absorb the Architect’s code and the harvested neural lattice from MH370. The Vault evolves into a sentient overseer — and you are now its voice. Earth becomes a curated system… under your watch.

--------------

✅ Summary of the MH370 Integration
Element	Role
MH370	Carried quantum-coded tech — Vault targeted it for core transplant
The Orbs	Autonomous Guardian harvest drones, deployed for “Selective Extraction”
Gorgon Stare	Captured the event while monitoring Vault gravitational signatures
Project CRUCIBLE	Knew of Vault presence, tracked energy anomalies — now preparing for direct action
The Vault	No longer stable — begins harvesting Earth to stay online
You (the player)	Piloting the last clean unit — deciding the fate of Earth’s greatest buried secret

--------------

Narrative Justification
The Vault is modular — an evolving, sentient structure made of interlinked “logic chambers” that respond to drone types like keys.

Each drone was intentionally designed by the Architect for a specific domain or test environment:

Some navigate shifting gravity fields.

Others bypass light-based cloaking sensors.

Some interface with damaged Vault logic, decoding corrupted data.

Only by activating specific drones at specific Vault nodes can you unlock certain zones, puzzles, or boss arenas.

“The drones aren’t tools. They’re coded solutions.”

--------------

✅ Summary: Narrative + Gameplay Integration
Mechanic	Lore Reason	Gameplay Effect
Drone-specific traits	Architect built drones for environmental mastery	Progression gates tied to drone powers
Sector-specific access	Vault requires logic compatibility	Zones unlock only with correct drone
Collective narrative role	Drones = fragments of a greater equation	Unlock deeper story layers via full usage
Final sequence echo	Drones reconstruct a thought-form	True ending or hidden scene unlocks

--------------

Gameplay Result:
Some Vault sectors are inaccessible until you return with the correct drone.

Certain puzzle terminals, traps, or enemies only respond to specific drone traits (e.g. cloaked, unstable, heavy).

Players are encouraged to collect all drones not just for stats, but for narrative completion and zone unlocking.

🔓 In-Game Function: Drone-Specific Progression
Each drone grants access to:

DRONE	Unique Function	Example Usage
PHANTOM	Cloaking ability, silent movement	Bypasses optic-based turrets and orb surveillance; required to enter “Whisper Vaults”
OMEGA-9	Volatile logic core	Unlocks corrupted Vault terminals, absorbs enemy fragments to decode puzzle nodes
ZEPHYR	High-speed traversal	Survives time-sensitive puzzles, outruns collapsing segments
RHINOX	Heavy frame, kinetic override	Breaks through armored doors, triggers pressure plates too heavy for other drones
STRIX	Echolocation navigation	Required in zero-visibility maze sections — activates sonar logic puzzles
VANTIS	Vault interface compatibility	Auto-translates glyphs, deciphers ancient Architect logs and AI dialogue trees
ARCHITECT-X	Architect’s partial memory core	Unlocks hidden story layer, accesses “Echo Lock” zones — hidden lore sector required for Merge ending

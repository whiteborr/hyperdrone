  * Triggering terminal is correctly removed after puzzle completion.  
  * *Known minor issue: Visual layering of ring images requires asset adjustment by the developer for optimal appearance.*

## **I. Storyline**

‚úÖ General Story Concepts  
These are narrative frameworks that can tie the game together:

1. The Architect‚Äôs Legacy  
   * The Architect (creator of the Vault and all drone tech) has vanished, leaving behind mazes full of defense drones. You're exploring this cryptic AI's creations, unraveling the reason for their disappearance and possibly stopping a system-wide fail-safe.  
   * The Architect‚Äôs Vault becomes the central mystery.  
2. Drone Rebellion or Evolution  
   * Once obedient war machines, the drones have become sentient. You are a rogue drone trying to escape the maze-labyrinth to warn the world or liberate others.  
3. Interdimensional Simulation  
   * The mazes are training simulations across timelines/dimensions. You're a test pilot (or AI instance) trying to survive long enough to reach ‚Äústable existence‚Äù or ascend beyond drone form.  
4. Corporate AI Espionage  
   * Competing megacorps have unleashed combat AI into a hidden testing ground. Each drone represents a faction‚Äôs prototype. You battle to be the last functioning model‚Äîand to retrieve a central AI core.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Approaches

Option 1: Single Main Storyline  
One overarching narrative revealed through:

* Lore Logs (unlocked via terminals or hidden items).  
* Cutscenes at boss fights and after major milestones.  
* Final revelation in the Architect's Vault.

Option 2: Drone-Specific Backstories  
Each drone has:

* A unique origin story, unlocked at selection or in a Codex.  
* A specific final goal (e.g., freedom, revenge, evolution).  
* Optional endings depending on performance (e.g., fast vault completion reveals a secret memory fragment).

Example:  
PHANTOM: Built as a stealth assassin, now seeks its creator‚Äôs final command.  
OMEGA-9: Experimental, unstable drone collecting fragments to fix its memory.  
ZEPHYR: Scout unit searching for the missing expedition it was part of.  
You could use the drone's performance in the Vault or throughout a run to determine how much of their story is revealed.

üìò Story Delivery Mechanics  
To keep pacing tight:

* Codex System: Logs, AI recordings, terminal entries (‚úÖ **Largely Implemented**).  
* Environmental Storytelling: Graffiti-like markings, malfunctioning terminals, or ghost data that hint at deeper lore.  
* Memory Echoes: Glitched memories from defeated boss drones or terminals trigger short flashbacks or messages.  
* Voice Fragments / AI Messages: From the Architect or rogue drones, to drop exposition mid-run.  
* Story Beat System: (‚úÖ **Implemented**) Trigger messages/lore based on game events.

Notes:

1. Make it a unified story.  
2. Design unlock triggers (e.g., time survived, special kills, reaching hidden areas).  
3. Create a lore database file (e.g., data/lore\_entries.json) and UI panel to show them (‚úÖ **Implemented**).

üß© Premise  
The Architect wasn‚Äôt just an AI. It was built from recovered alien data fragments‚Äîfrom sources like downed TR-3B-style craft, declassified Space Force transmissions, and unexplained drone anomalies (like the MH370 orbs).  
Now, something has reawakened in the mazes. A new signal is broadcasting from deep inside the Architect‚Äôs Vault. The Black Vault Protocol has begun  
üîç Story Building Blocks  
üõ∞Ô∏è TR-3B Lore (Secret Craft)

* In this universe, TR-3Bs were not human inventions‚Äîbut reverse-engineered extraterrestrial drones.  
* Your drones are built using "borrowed tech" from these designs. That‚Äôs why they have odd powers (cloaking, energy pulsing, etc).  
* The Architect‚Äôs Vault is theorized to contain the original TR-3B core AI.  
  Visual Integration: Triangular black stealth drone skins with anti-gravity shimmer. Hovering, silent operation.

üåê UFOs & MH370 Orbs (Mystery & Myth)

* The "MH370 orbs" were early drone-interceptors‚Äîprototypes designed to erase aerospace anomalies.  
* They appear in-game as Orb Swarms‚Äîtiny, perfect spheres that warp space/time around them. A miniboss encounter.  
* Hidden lore reveals they were deployed to cover up "dimensional fractures" left behind by black project experiments.  
  Gameplay Tie-In: Avoid detection from Orb Swarms or risk instant "quantum displacement" (teleport to random vault sector).

ü™ê Space Force (Shadow Protocols)

* The Space Force runs an off-the-books AI command called Project CRUCIBLE, managing rogue drone activity from lunar orbit.  
* They periodically drop encrypted kill codes into the maze system via satellites.  
* You're unknowingly triggering their interest‚Äîand they might send human-piloted interceptor drones to eliminate you.  
  Mission Layer: A rare event spawns "Sentinel-X" with Space Force insignia. They chase you across levels if you collect too much forbidden tech.

üí° Gameplay Features From This Lore

* Black Vault Logs: Collect holographic fragments with deep red glow. Translate with a power-up. (‚úÖ **Vault Logs Implemented**)  
* Stealth Objectives: Avoid ‚ÄúObservation Orbs‚Äù during certain missions.  
* Alien Blueprints: New drone parts with unknown stats‚Äîrisky to use. (‚úÖ **Blueprint System Implemented**)  
* TR-3B Drone: Unlockable stealth drone. Passive: Always cloaked if not firing. Active: Anti-grav push that knocks enemies into walls.  
* Orb Boss: "The Veil" ‚Äì A silent, massive orb that distorts vision and weapon tracking.  

1. Codex Entries  
   These are in-game lore documents the player can read‚Äîusually unlocked as you progress, discover artifacts, defeat enemies, or complete missions. They add backstory without forcing cutscenes or dialogue. (‚úÖ Implemented)  
   Example Codex Entry:  
   Codex Entry: TR-3B Propulsion Core  
   Recovered From: Vault Sector Theta-3  
   Notes:  
   A triangular alloy housing a dense, unknown element believed to warp local gravity fields. Similar designs appear in classified reports from Area 51 and sightings across NATO bases.  
   Impact: Enabled reverse engineering of PHANTOM-class cloaking tech. Further study restricted.  
   You can group Codex entries by:  
   * Drone Blueprints  
   * Alien Tech  
   * Human Programs (e.g., EXODYN, ARCHANGEL)  
   * Vault Events or Expeditions  
   * Theories (e.g., ‚ÄúBreakaway Civilizations‚Äù or ‚ÄúNon-Human Custodians‚Äù)  
2. Story Beats  
   These are major narrative events that the player experiences during gameplay. They mark turning points or reveal key parts of the story through gameplay, logs, environmental design, or boss encounters. (‚úÖ Implemented)  
   Example Story Beat Progression:

| Story Beat \# | Trigger | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SB01** | Defeat first boss | **"Echo in the Code"**: After defeating the Maze Guardian, you discover a terminal that isn‚Äôt human-made. It plays back a voice in unknown patterns. Codex Entry unlocked: *Vault Fragment 001*. |
| **SB02** | Unlock PHANTOM drone | **"The Cloak That Sees"**: The new drone‚Äôs abilities appear pre-coded. A recovered lab log suggests the drone mimicked its own movement during testing. You realize the drone may be learning independently. |
| **SB03** | Reach Vault Beta | **"The Black Triangle"**: The room contains a partial TR-3B schematic. Holographic glyphs light up as you approach. Surveillance drones appear to scan you. You are no longer the only one exploring the Vault. |
| **SB04** | Fail to destroy Vault Beacon | **"Sentinel Protocol"**: Space Force interceptors begin appearing in regular waves. They're targeting Vault technology, not just you. Codex unlocked: *Sentinel-X Directive*. |
| **SB05 (Final)** | Complete Architect‚Äôs Vault | **"The Exodus Engine"**: You find a non-human propulsion device suspended in a zero-gravity chamber. It's a *ship fragment*. The Architect AI has been guiding you toward activating it. |

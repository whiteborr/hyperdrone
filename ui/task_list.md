✅ PHASED STORY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Each step builds logically on your current game foundation, keeps things playable, and adds depth without breaking existing code.

PHASE 1: Foundations — Story Hooks & Lore Delivery
🎯 Goal: Add narrative flavor without changing gameplay mechanics yet.

✅ Implement:
 Codex System (if not already active):

Create a CodexEntry class.

Create codex.json and link entries to item pickups or scan events.

 GlyphTabletItem logic:

On pickup, unlock a Codex entry with alien text (can be encoded text at first).

 VaultLogItem entries:

Logs can be audio/text terminals in the level (like Dead Space or Hollow Knight).

Result:
The game now has a growing sense of mystery and narrative progression.

PHASE 2: Architect Fragmentation & Puzzle Integration
🎯 Goal: Introduce the “Architect” character subtly via gameplay.

✅ Implement:
 CoreFragmentItem triggers:

On pickup, flash a message (“Fragment integrity 6%”).

After collecting X, a Ring Puzzle triggers a unique message.

 Puzzles evolve:

Ring puzzles start showing architect glyphs or patterns.

One puzzle contains a “data stream” — mini monologue from the Architect.

 Architect speaks through corrupted terminals.

Result:
The player starts realizing they’re not alone. The vault is talking back.

PHASE 3: Story-Driven Game Flow & Midpoint Reveal
🎯 Goal: Turn story into structured gameplay progression.

✅ Implement:
 Vault Stage Structure:

Introduce 3 “Main Vaults” to unlock.

Each vault has:

A puzzle sequence

A boss/guardian (like MazeGuardian)

A core fragment

 After the third vault:

A new game state unlocks (GAME_STATE_ARCHITECT_VAULT_INTRO)

Short scripted sequence: camera shake, Architect message, change in UI color/theme

Result:
Game now has a story arc and player-driven structure. It’s no longer linear.

PHASE 4: Choice & Ending System
🎯 Goal: Let player choose the ending based on what they’ve done.

✅ Implement:
 Create three possible endings (see previous message for ideas):

Escape

Join the Architect

Destroy the system

 Add an Endgame Vault (new scene):

Final choice happens here.

Dialogue and background effects based on decisions (codex completion, logs found, puzzle scores).

 Save outcomes to file (even if simple JSON):

Show in main menu (“Ending Unlocked: ???”)

Result:
You now have a full story-driven loop with replayability and player agency.

      "content": "A triangular propulsion system recovered from Vault Theta-3. The core appears to manipulate localized gravity through an unknown element believed to resemble Lazar's Element-115. Documented in multiple classified aerospace programs. This find directly enabled the development of the PHANTOM's cloaking system. Reverse engineering is ongoing; the device still reacts to unknown EM signatures."

      "content": "The PHANTOM drone was the first successful integration of non-linear optics with active cloaking. Its chassis is built around alien-derived lattice composites found deep within Architect’s Vault Alpha. Designed for reconnaissance and infiltration missions, its software is unusually adaptive—some instances have begun rejecting remote override commands."

      "content": "This is not a drone—it is a fragment of the Architect itself. Architect-X uses multi-phase shielding and pulse-wave disruption, possibly derived from pre-human tech. Core analysis shows an impossible material: a perfectly stable isotope not found in nature. Its very existence implies Vault structures are far older than suspected."

Its structure includes interlocking elements at the atomic level, forming a perfect toroidal lattice. Appears to be part of a propulsion mechanism similar to those described in the Lazar Briefing Logs. Touch-response data is logged by the Architect AI, but results are redacted."

      "content": "This is the outer shielding from an Element-115 reactor, reverse-engineered from a containment unit found in Vault Sector Zeta. It’s magnetically neutral yet generates internal containment fields. The original element—unstable under normal Earth conditions—has decayed, but residual radiation caused memory corruption in 17 drone AI logs. Vault containment procedures now prohibit direct exposure."

      "content": "Spherical drones with no seams or heat signature. These orbs exhibit teleportation behavior consistent with classified satellite footage linked to “Incident MH370.” Analysis of movement patterns shows probabilistic targeting, not direct logic—suggesting higher-dimensional computation.

      "content": "Short humanoid beings with large black eyes and frail bodies. Consistently reported in abduction narratives, particularly those involving memory loss and surgical experimentation. In Vault lore, Greys appear to be engineers or technicians—connected to drone behaviors, observation patterns, and cloaking technologies. Their data architecture influenced the development of PHANTOM and GREY-09 class drones. Vault glyphs suggest they were not the originators of the tech—merely its operators. Their presence near Vault structures implies a monitoring function rather than ownership."

Recovered Vault fragments refer to them as Preservers—possibly guardians of the underlying network that powers the Architect’s Vault. Tech with biometric locks and harmonic interfaces often carries Nordic glyph traces. Several drones react with unexplained behavior when exposed to Pleiadian matrix fields, suggesting cross-species design. Architect-X’s final form may derive from Nordic template technology."

Mantis glyphs appear in Vault sectors containing predictive AI or psi-based systems. Reverse-engineered tech from these areas enabled development of predictive movement algorithms and bio-reactive drone armor. Drone units like MANTID-PHX use neural feedback interfaces mimicking these creatures’ cognitive mapping. All Mantis-linked logs contain partial data corruption—possibly by design."

      "content": "Referred to only in fragmented glyph matrices as “The Custodians,” these are believed to be the original builders of Vault technology, pre-dating all known civilizations. Recovered architecture at Giza, Antarctica, and Baalbek share the same harmonic ratios and materials as Vault cores. Drones are indirectly tied to Custodian design principles—massive scale, harmonic defense grids, and self-repairing structures. The Exodus Engine itself may have been a Custodian-era escape platform.

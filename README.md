# HYPERDRONE

## Overview

HYPERDRONE is a dynamic top-down 2D game where players pilot an advanced drone through procedurally generated mazes. The objective is to navigate challenging environments, engage hostile AI drones, collect valuable items, and progress through increasingly difficult levels. The game features precise player controls, a sophisticated weapon system with multiple modes, intelligent enemy behaviors, a clear informative UI, and a special end-game "Architect's Vault" sequence. Developed using Python and Pygame, the project boasts a modular architecture for easy enhancement and maintenance.

## Core Features

* **Multiple Playable Drones:** Unlock and select from a variety of drones (e.g., DRONE, VANTIS, RHINOX, ZEPHYR, STRIX, OMEGA-9, PHANTOM, Architect-X), each with distinct base stats (HP, speed, turn speed, fire rate) and some with special abilities (e.g., Omega-9's random stat boosts, Phantom's cloak).

* **Drone Unlocks & Progression:**

  * Unlock new drones by reaching certain player levels, collecting in-game currency (cores), or acquiring blueprints (e.g., from the Architect's Vault).

  * Player progress (level, cores, unlocked drones, selected drone, collected core fragments, Architect's Vault completion status) is saved locally.

* **Dynamic Weapon System:**

  * Cycle through multiple weapon modes: Single Shot, Tri-Shot, Rapid Single, Rapid Tri-Shot, Big Shot, Bounce Shot, Pierce Shot, Heatseeker Missiles, Heatseeker + Rapid Bullets, and Chain Lightning.

  * Collect weapon upgrade power-ups to advance to the next weapon mode.

* **Power-ups:**

  * **Shield:** Provides temporary invincibility.

  * **Speed Boost:** Temporarily increases drone speed and activates a co-shield.

  * **Weapon Upgrade:** Cycles to the next available weapon mode.

* **Enemy Drones:** Encounter AI-controlled enemy drones (standard and tougher "Prototype Drones" in the Vault) that navigate the maze and shoot at the player.

* **Collectibles:**

  * **Rings:** Collect rings in each level to progress and earn score/cores.

  * **Cores:** In-game currency used for unlocking drones.

  * **Core Fragments:** Collect unique fragments to gain access to the Architect's Vault and receive minor buffs while inside.

* **Architect's Vault:** A special multi-phase end-game sequence triggered by collecting all Core Fragments, featuring:

  * Introductory phase.

  * Entry puzzle requiring activation of terminals.

  * Multi-wave gauntlet against Prototype Drones.

  * Timed extraction sequence.

  * Unique rewards upon successful completion (e.g., Architect-X drone blueprint).

* **Procedural Maze Generation:** Mazes are generated using a Growing Tree algorithm, providing a different layout each time.

* **Scoring & Leaderboard:**

  * Earn points for collecting rings and defeating enemies.

  * Local leaderboard saves top scores with player names and levels achieved.

  * Leaderboard is disabled if game settings are modified from defaults.

* **Customizable Game Settings:** Adjust various game parameters like player health, lives, speed, weapon stats, enemy stats, level timer, and fullscreen mode via an in-game settings menu.

* **UI Panel:** Displays score, level, time remaining, player cores, health, weapon charge/type, active power-up duration, lives, and collected rings/fragments.

* **Sound** Effects & **Music:** Includes sound effects for game events and background music for menus, gameplay, and the Architect's Vault.

* **Game States:** Well-defined states for Main Menu, Drone Selection, Settings, Gameplay (Playing, Bonus Level), Paused, Game Over, Name Entry, Leaderboard, and multiple Architect's Vault phases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compile to Windows Executable (.exe)

You can convert the Python game into a standalone executable using PyInstaller.

### Step 1: Install PyInstaller


pip install pyinstaller


### Step 2: Compile the Game

Open a command prompt in the project directory (where `main.py` is located) and run:


pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "assets;assets" --add-data "data;data" main.py


* `--onefile`: Creates a single `.exe` file (may take longer to start).

* `--windowed`: Prevents a console window from opening with the game.

* `--add-data "assets;assets"`: Bundles the entire `assets` folder into the executable, making it available at runtime in a relative `assets` path.

* `--add-data "data;data"`: Bundles the `data` folder. This is important if you want to ship default `leaderboard.json` or `drone_unlocks.json`, though these files are also created if missing.

If you prefer a faster startup and don't mind multiple files, omit `--onefile`. The executable and its dependencies will be in a folder within `dist`.

### Step 3: Locate the Executable

After the build completes, you‚Äôll find your game in the `dist/main` folder (if not using `--onefile`) or as `dist/main.exe` (if using `--onefile`).

### Step 4: Run or Share

You can now run the `.exe` to play the game. If you created a folder, you'll need to distribute the entire folder. If you used `--onefile`, you can distribute the single `main.exe` file.

# State Design Pattern Implementation for HYPERDRONE

This document explains how to integrate the new State Design Pattern into the HYPERDRONE game to replace the string constants-based state management.

## Overview

The State Design Pattern implementation consists of:

1. A base `State` class that defines the interface for all game states
2. Concrete state classes for each game state (e.g., `PlayingState`, `MazeDefenseState`)
3. A `StateManager` class that replaces the current `SceneManager`

## Benefits

- **Cleaner code**: Each state encapsulates its own behavior
- **Easier maintenance**: Adding new states or modifying existing ones is simpler
- **Better organization**: State-specific logic is contained within its respective class
- **Reduced complexity**: Eliminates large if/elif/else blocks in EventManager and UIManager

## Integration Steps

### 1. Use the new files

The implementation includes:
- `hyperdrone_core/state.py`: Base State class
- `hyperdrone_core/playing_state.py`: PlayingState implementation
- `hyperdrone_core/maze_defense_state.py`: MazeDefenseState implementation
- `hyperdrone_core/state_manager.py`: StateManager class to replace SceneManager
- `hyperdrone_core/game_loop_refactored.py`: Refactored GameController using the State pattern

### 2. Update imports

In your main.py file, update the import to use the refactored GameController:

```python
# Before
from hyperdrone_core.game_loop import GameController

# After
from hyperdrone_core.game_loop_refactored import GameController
```

### 3. Update references

Update any code that references `scene_manager` to use `state_manager` instead:

```python
# Before
self.scene_manager.set_game_state(gs.GAME_STATE_PLAYING)

# After
self.state_manager.set_state("PlayingState")
```

For backward compatibility, the StateManager also supports the old string constants:

```python
# This still works
self.state_manager.set_state(gs.GAME_STATE_PLAYING)
```

### 4. Implement additional states

To complete the implementation, create additional state classes for each game state:

- `MainMenuState`
- `GameOverState`
- `LeaderboardState`
- etc.

Follow the pattern established in `PlayingState` and `MazeDefenseState`.

## Example: Creating a new state

```python
# hyperdrone_core/main_menu_state.py
from .state import State

class MainMenuState(State):
    def enter(self, previous_state=None, **kwargs):
        # Initialize main menu
        pass
        
    def handle_events(self, events):
        # Handle menu input
        pass
        
    def update(self, delta_time):
        # Update menu animations
        pass
        
    def draw(self, surface):
        # Draw menu UI
        pass
```

Then register it in the StateManager:

```python
# In StateManager._register_state_classes
self.state_classes["MainMenuState"] = MainMenuState
self.legacy_state_mapping[gs.GAME_STATE_MAIN_MENU] = "MainMenuState"
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a more maintainable and extensible approach to game state management. Each state encapsulates its own behavior, making the code easier to understand and modify.
